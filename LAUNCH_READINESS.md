## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Single Server (MVP Launch)
```bash
# Recommended for initial launch
- 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM server
- Docker Compose deployment
- Cost: ~$40-80/month
- Supports 10-50 concurrent users
```

### Option 2: Cloud Managed Services
```bash
# AWS Example
- ECS for game-server
- RDS PostgreSQL (db.t3.medium)
- ElastiCache Redis (cache.t3.micro)
- Application Load Balancer
- Cost: ~$100-200/month
```

### Option 3: Kubernetes
```bash
# For scaling beyond 100 users
- EKS/GKE/AKS cluster

## Known Limitations (MVP)

These are acceptable for initial launch:

1. **LLM Performance:** Ollama response time can be 5-15 seconds
   - *Mitigation:* User sees "generating..." state
   
2. **World Generation Time:** Complex worlds may take 30-60 seconds
   - *Mitigation:* Progress indicators, async processing
   
3. **Concurrent User Limit:** Initial target is 10-50 users
   - *Mitigation:* Horizontal scaling documented

4. **No Email Verification:** Users can register without email confirmation
   - *Post-launch:* Add email service integration

5. **Basic Error Messages:** Some errors are generic
   - *Post-launch:* Enhance error messaging
