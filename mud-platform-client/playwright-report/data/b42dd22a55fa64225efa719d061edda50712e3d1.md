          - text: I'm so excited to dive deeper into your world-building journey!
          - text: Let's get back to that core concept - what resonates with you? Did you envision a world of high fantasy, gritty realism, or something entirely unique?
        - generic [ref=e19]: "> reply High Fantasy"

          - text: Now that we have a core concept of High Fantasy, let's talk about the sentient species in your world. To help me better understand, can you give me a rough idea of what kind of intelligent beings you're envisioning? Are they humanoid (like humans or elves), or something entirely different?
        - generic [ref=e23]: "> reply Elves and Humans"
        - generic [ref=e24]: The statue listens intently...

          - text: Can you give me a sense of what kind of environments these two species might inhabit? Are there any forests, mountains, or waterways that are particularly significant to either species?

          - text: So, let's talk about how magic fits into your world. Are we talking about a world where magic is an integral part of everyday life, or more of a rare and exclusive phenomenon that only certain individuals possess?
        - generic [ref=e31]: "> reply High Magic"
        - generic [ref=e32]: The statue listens intently...

          - text: "Now that we have High Magic on the table, I want to clarify: how does this high level of magical power impact the balance of power in your world? Are there powerful magical factions or individuals who wield more magic than others, or is it more evenly distributed?"
          - text: (And don't worry if it's still a bit fuzzy – we'll get there!)

          - text: For our next topic, Geological Age, I was wondering if you'd like to give me a sense of how old your world is geologically? Is it a young land with sharp peaks still forming from volcanic activity, or an older world with more mature mountains that have been shaped by time and erosion?
          - text: (And don't worry about the Dark Lord - we'll get to that later!)
